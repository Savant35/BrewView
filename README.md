    BrewView is a dynamic front-end application designed to showcase a coffee shop's product offerings. It features an interactive, filterable catalog driven by real-time data to provide users with a fast and intuitive browsing experience. The primary goal was to build a modern, scalable product display layer completely decoupled from the back-end logic, utilizing Appwrite as a powerful and flexible data source.
